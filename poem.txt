once, i ran a stand that sold leases to some rather bland land
Where neither wheat nor corn could be grown
but still i thought it was neat, until i had to take a loan
To pay for food I should have grown, now all my meals are canned
perhaps i could eat some wheat i'd grown if gmo wasn't banned
The recent legislation makes farming life a bore
i wish i could continue that good 'ol cancer crops lore
Lucky for me the feds haven't touched msg
there's no more soul in farming, how depressed could one guy be?
So here I stand, a joyless man, waiting to lease my poor, bland land
